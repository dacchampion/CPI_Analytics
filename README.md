# CPI Analytics
 
These simple scripts analyze the Corruption Perception Index and its possible correlations with World Bank Indicators.

In order to grab a better understanding of these correlations, the analysis is splitted in three groups according to CPI improvements:
* Decreasing CPI
* Non-chaning
* Increasing CPI

In that way, it is possible to visually compare the trends with the following indicators:
- Internet Access
- Education Expenditure
- Urban growth
